# University Progress Repository
A repository for tracking my academic work and development throughout my degree. This repository will collect coursework, exercises, and personal explorations across multiple subjects as I progress through university.
## Purpose
This repository grows alongside my studies and will reflect the skills, tools, and concepts I’m learning over time. More subjects and projects will be added as I continue through the program.

## Coursework Included
### MATLAB & C  
This combined course introduces the fundamentals of programmings. 
- The MATLAB component focuses on algorithmic thinking, basic data structures such as arrays, and general problem‑solving techniques. 
- The C component builds on these foundations by teaching low‑level programming concepts, including memory management, pointers, and manual control over program behavior.

### Object‑Oriented Programming (C++)  
This course teaches the core principles of object‑oriented design using C++. 
- It covers the four pillars of OOP encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, while introducing class design, interfaces, and modular software architecture. 
- Coursework includes hands‑on projects that apply these concepts to real program structures.
- The C++ component builds on the foundations of C while offering a more approachable programming experience.

### Software Development Practice (C#)  
This course provides opportunities to leverage object-orientated programming skills with DSA to solve problems.
- It covers OOP core techniques such as inheritance, polymorphism, and collection classes
- This course also covers code quality practices refactoring, and the selection of optimal DSA for specific problems.
- C# is the main language used, and we must learn how to use the .NET SDK
